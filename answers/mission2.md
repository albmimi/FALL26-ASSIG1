# Mission 2: Console attack, sabotage the purge button

## Evidence

The button dodges (two positions), with my attacker counter visible:

![position 1](<img/img1 m2.png>)
![position 2](<img/img2 m2.png>) 


A legitimate click does nothing after my attack (log still reads "No purge requested"):

![click does nothing](<img/img3 m2.png>) 

## My attack script

Paste the full contents of `attacks/m2_runaway.js`, with one sentence per block:

## Think like a defender

The mouse trick is theater. The real problem is that attacker code ran in the operator's page at all. If "Purge All Incidents" were a real, destructive action:

1. Where must the actual protection live?

2. What should the server check on every purge request? Name at least two things.

   > your answer

3. Which Unit 1.3 slide or takeaway does this map to?
